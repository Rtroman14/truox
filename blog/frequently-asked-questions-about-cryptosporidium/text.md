Frequently Asked Questions about Cryptosporidium

Cryptosporidium outbreaks in pools have been on the rise in the past few years. The CDC reports that the number of outbreaks has increased by more than 13% each year. And because these outbreaks can be so detrimental to your pool in so many ways, we thought we would answer a few of the most frequently asked questions about cryptosporidium. The more you know about the parasite, the more prepared you and your pool’s staff can be.

What is cryptosporidium?

Cryptosporidium is a very small parasite that causes cryptosporidiosis. These small parasites can be found in a variety of places, like food, soil, and, most importantly to you as a pool operator, water. The main characteristic of Cryptosporidium is that it is found in places that have been contaminated with feces of someone or something that has been infected with the parasite. It’s also the leading cause of waterborne disease outbreaks.

How is cryptosporidiosis spread?

Because cryptosporidium lives in the stomach of an infected human or animal, the main way it is spread is through poop. There are tens to hundreds of millions of cryptosporidium parasites that are expelled in a single bowel movement, and swallowing as few as 10 of these can cause you to get sick.

The main way that the disease is spread is through swallowing infected water in pools, lakes, rivers, and more. But the main point is that, if water or food has been infected by the disease, ingesting even a very small amount could infect you.

What are the symptoms?

The most common symptom of the disease is watery diarrhea. It is also the main way to spread the disease as well, which is why it is so important to make sure that anyone with an upset stomach avoids your pool.

The symptoms usually begin showing signs 2 to 10 days after someone has ingested the germ, and can come with stomach pain, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss, among others. These symptoms will typically last 1 to 2 weeks.

Who is most at risk?

There are a few groups that are more at risk than others. The first group is children and people who regularly deal with children. This, unsurprisingly, is because you’re dealing with a lot more poop than usual when you’re dealing with children. Young children are also more likely to become dehydrated because of the diarrhea that comes with disease.

The second group is anyone who has to drink water from untreated sources. Because the disease is spread by ingesting the parasite in one way or another, this shouldn’t be too much of a surprise. So, if you’re drinking from contaminated water sources, there is a much more likely chance that you will drink cryptosporidium and become infected.

What should you do if you think you have it?

If you’re having diarrhea and aren’t sure where it came from, there are a few things you can do to help get some relief. The main thing you need to do is to stay as hydrated as possible. The diarrhea can really dehydrate someone, so making sure you’re getting as many fluids as possible. You should also avoid drinks with caffeine and alcohol, as these can be another source of dehydration. Lastly, you should try to eat as well-balanced of a diet as possible, which can help speed up recovery.

How is cryptosporidiosis diagnosed?

Because the disease is spread through an infected person’s poop, the main way to tell if someone has it is through a stool sample. Possibly infected patients may be asked to give up to three samples on three different days because the parasite can be shed irregularly, so there can be false negatives.

How can you protect yourself and others?

There are a few different ways to help prevent the spread of cryptosporidium. The first one is avoiding any food or water that may have been contaminated. If you’re not totally sure if the water you’re drinking is safe, it’s best to avoid and drink from bottled water, if possible. You’ll also want to avoid any fruits or vegetables that may have been washed in infected water.

If you have children or work with them, there are a few more steps you should be taking. If a child has diarrhea, you should remove them from the group until it has stopped. You should also absolutely make sure that a possibly infected child avoids swimming. Lastly, regularly clean all toys and surfaces to prevent the spread of the bacteria.

These are just a few of the frequently asked questions and a good place to begin if you are just learning about cryptosporidium and how it can affect your pool. It’s a crappy parasite, pun fully intended, that can survive even in chlorinated pools. But the more knowledgeable you are about the causes and effects of cryptosporidium, the less likely it is to cause an outbreak at your pool.
