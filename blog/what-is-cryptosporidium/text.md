What is Cryptosporidium?

As a pool owner and operator, you’re sure to be aware of the big rules. No running around the pool. No diving in the shallow end. And of course, no pooping in the pool. And while all of these rules are in there to make sure your pool is as safe as possible, do you know why it’s so important to make sure that people are not defecating in your pool?

The answer to that question is something called cryptosporidium. Cryptosporidium, or crypto as it’s sometimes referred to, is one of the leading causes of recreational water illnesses. This germ is very chlorine-tolerant, meaning it can be found even in a regularly maintained and cleaned pool. And because it has a very tough outer shell, it can stay in your pool for days or even weeks at a time.

This nasty parasite is most commonly spread through ingesting pool water that has been contaminated with crypto. Because you share the pool water with everyone who’s entered, it only takes one person to be infected with the disease to use the bathroom in the pool for it to spread. This one person will release tens to hundreds of millions of crypto germs, and you only need to swallow a little bit of it to become sick yourself.

What does becoming infected with cryptosporidium all entail? The most common side effect is diarrhea for 1-2 weeks, which is also the main way to continue to spread the disease. On top of that, you may experience stomach cramps, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss.

So it’s safe to say, if you are experiencing any of these symptoms, avoid the pool until you’re feeling back to normal. Even a small amount of cryptosporidium can affect swimmers if they swallow it, so you’ll want to stay out of the water. But what other precautions should you be taking? One of the most important is obviously to stay out of the pool if you have diarrhea or any sort of upset stomach.

You should also implement some sort of bathroom breaks for your pool. If there are hourly breaks for everyone to get out of the pool to use the bathroom, you’re much more likely to avoid an accident in your pool. It can also be used as a time for parents to check to make sure that their children have avoided going to the bathroom during their time in the pool.

Cases of cryptosporidiosis have increased year after year and can cause your pool to shut down for a few weeks if not properly taken care of. And because the parasite can successfully live in chlorinated water, it’s something that you need to constantly be checking on. Make sure that every guest at your pool knows how important it is to not go in the water if they have had any sort of upset stomach or diarrhea, and immediately clear the pool if you do happen to see that someone has pooped in your pool.

Also, stay tuned in the upcoming months, because Truox is going to be unveiling a product shortly that could be the solution to this common pool problem. But in the meantime, make sure that your staff and guests are aware of the causes of crypto and the issues that it could bring. The more educated everyone is on the rules of the pool, the less likely that you’ll have an issue and the more enjoyable the experience will be for everyone.
