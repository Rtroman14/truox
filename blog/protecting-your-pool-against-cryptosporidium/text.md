Protecting Your Pool From Cryptosporidium
blog

Well, it happened. Someone pooped in your pool. You did everything right, getting people out of the pool as soon as it was spotted, but that’s just the first step in a series of things you need to do. One of the worst things that could happen at your pool is an outbreak of illnesses, especially cryptosporidium. This can hurt your pool’s reputation or, even worse, shut down your facility.

Cryptosporidium, or “Crypto” as it’s sometimes referred to, outbreaks are not only harmful to the swimmers but can be detrimental to your facility as a whole. It’s one of the most common causes of outbreaks linked to pools and has a tough outer shell that can help it survive for days even in treated pools. And because symptoms of crypto can take 10 days to appear after someone is infected, you could be unknowingly letting swimmers play in a pool that carries the disease.

Because these crypto outbreaks can be so hazardous to swimmers and your facility, you need to have a plan of attack for them. And since crypto is very difficult to kill with chlorine alone (and can actually live comfortably in a pool that’s just treated with chlorine), there are a few different effective systems that you can use for your pool.

UV Pool Systems

These systems use ultraviolet lamps to treat the pool water against crypto, decreasing the infectivity of the parasite. But one thing that you should keep in mind is that they don’t actually destroy crypto but inactivate it by damaging the DNA. While the damaged DNA can rebuild itself, it is doubtful that the repaired crypto will get its infectivity back.

Another thing to be aware of when considering a UV pool system is that they require exposing the organisms to high levels of UV radiation. This uses a lot of energy and can be very costly if the problem continues to occur. Also, these UV lamps can become dirty, which reduces the effectiveness of the treatment and can require maintenance to be done on fragile, expensive parts.

Ozone Pool Systems

Another widely used system to prevent crypto outbreaks, the ozone pool system uses UV lamps or electricity to produce ozone gas. This oxidizes the pool water, destroying the crypto. But because ozone gas is toxic, ozone generators will typically create low amounts of ozone, meaning it can take a long time to ozonate the pool, leaving crypto in your pool for days. Also, ozone pool systems have limited capabilities because they cannot scale and treat large pools, like competition pools, water parks, and larger aquatic facility rec centers.

AOP Pool Systems

While the other two systems have been around for quite some time, AOP systems have more recently been introduced and are one of the most effective sanitation systems when it comes to the fight against crypto. These systems work by producing hydroxyl radicals, one of the most potent oxidizing agents that are safe to use in your pool. Because of this, these radicals destroy crypto better than UV and ozone and also leave no toxic residuals. There are two main kinds of AOP systems.

The first of these systems is called Ozone-UV AOP. This system works by combining ozone and UV to create the hydroxyl radicals. By using both the benefits of UV and ozone systems together, this system is much more effective than just using one or the other. But you’ll run into similar problems of scalability as you did because you are still using ozone.

The other main AOP system is hydroxyl-based, creating the hydroxyl radicals by treating oxygen in the atmosphere. This process produces O1, a type of free radical called atomic oxygen, and directly puts it into the pool water. By doing this, it makes more hydroxyl radicals than any other system discussed above and also eliminates the high energy use and maintenance of the UV system and the toxic gases made by the ozone systems. It also has been proven to reduce crypto and other recreational water illness bacteria by 99.99%.

Safe to say, there are options out there that can help you eliminate the risk that crypto presents to your pool facility. Shutdowns can be costly and can also tarnish a previously perfect reputation. You don’t want to be known around town as the pool that people get sick at, so having a plan of attack to keep swimmers healthy and having fun is a necessity.
