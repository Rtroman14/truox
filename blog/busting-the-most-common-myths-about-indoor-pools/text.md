The 5 Most Common Myths About Indoor Pools – Busted!

Myth #1: Indoor pools are less sanitary than outdoor pools.

At Truox, we are indoor pool maintenance experts and nothing drives us crazier than this myth. We don’t know who started it, but we would like to have a few words with them!

It doesn’t matter if a pool is inside or outside, they are both perfectly sanitary when properly cared for and can become equally unsanitary when not properly cared for. There have been no studies that show the water in indoor pools is any less safe than the water in outdoor pools, so feel free to swim in either as often as you would like!

Myth #2: If the pool area smells clean, it is clean.

Just because something smells clean, doesn’t mean it necessarily is clean. The smell of harsh cleaning products in any environment – pools, public restrooms, etc. – create a false sense of cleanliness in our minds, which is often the point of using those harsh chemicals. But, it is still important to take proper precautions to stay healthy. Protect yourself by always wearing shoes when you’re out of the water and washing your hands after touching a high contact surface.

Myth #3: Indoor pools are more likely to turn your hair green.

Many blondes reading this post may have personally experienced their hair turning green after a swim, but despite the rumors you’ve heard, the chlorine isn’t entirely to blame and an indoor pool certainly isn’t to blame.

Copper in the water, not chlorine, is actually the main culprit behind post-swim green locks. Copper is found in all water, even tap water, and enough exposure to copper alone can turn your hair green on it’s own. However, when chlorine and copper bond together, they create a film that sticks to the proteins found in human hair, causing blonde hair to turn green.

If this ever happens to you, know that it is only temporary and it is just as likely to happen at an outdoor pool as it is at an indoor pool.

Myth #4: Thunder and lightning storms don’t impact indoor pools.

While there may not be any documented cases of anyone being injured or killed due to lightning storms at indoor pools, there are documented cases of people being electrocuted in the shower or bath. Thus, you still need to clear indoor pools during a lighting storm as a precaution. While it might not seem necessary, the risk is not worth a few extra minutes of fun.

Myth #5: Indoor pools are harder to upkeep than outdoor pools.

While it is true that indoor pools do require additional investment at first, they are no easier or more difficult to maintain than outdoor pools. Each comes with a unique set of challenges and requirements to function safely and the maintenance needs for either should be carefully reviewed before breaking ground on the project.

We might be biased, but we think the facts speak for themselves. Indoor pools are just as safe, wonderful, and fun as outdoor pools, maybe even more so!
