Keeping Your Pool Safe This Summer
blog, Safety

There’s truly nothing better than that first dive into a pool on a hot summer day. Whether indoor or outdoor, a pool can be a sanctuary for you and your family in the dog days of summer. But, while fun can and absolutely should be had, there are also a few dangers of a pool. With summer right around the corner, the team at Truox thought it would be a good idea to go over some helpful safety tips for your pool!

Inspect the Area Around Your Pool

One of the most common things you’ve heard in terms of pool safety is “No running around the pool!” That’s because slipping and falling into a pool can be incredibly dangerous. If you fall unexpectedly into the pool, there’s a very good chance you’ll be caught off guard. There’s also a good chance that you injure yourself in the fall, which can make it hard to safely get out of the pool and can lead to catastrophic consequences. So make sure that all the toys and games are properly put away and clean up any spills or wet spots that can lead to slipping as soon as possible.

Have a Trained, Knowledgeable Staff

Easier said than done, but having a crew you can trust will improve your peace of mind while also improving the safety of your aquatic facility. By having responsible people running the day-to-day operations of your pool, you can be sure that your swimmers are in good hands. Obviously, one of the most important jobs that your staff will have is making sure everyone in the pool is safe and having fun. That includes enforcing rules like no dunking and no running, and also includes knowing CPR and other first-aid necessities in case worse comes to worst.

Another benefit to having a trained staff is their ability to teach new swimmers the ropes. The more knowledgeable your swimmers are about the rules of the pool, the less likely an incident. And the more comfortable they are in the pool, the less worried you have to be that anything out of the ordinary will happen.

Maintain Your Chemical Levels

Having a swimmer leave with red, puffy eyes is never a good sign. Recreational water illnesses are some of the most common issues found in indoor pools. The chloramines rise from the surface of the pool, creating a murky atmosphere, complete with a lingering odor. But these problems can be kept under wraps if you are regularly checking and maintaining your chemical levels.

There are several easy, inexpensive test kits that you can buy to make sure that your chemical levels are balanced. Or, you could get the Breathe EZ system from Truox installed today.
