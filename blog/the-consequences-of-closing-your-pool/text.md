The Consequences of Closing Your Pool
blog

There are only a few things worse for an indoor pool facility owner than having to shut down their pool. Even if it’s only for a few days, the results and consequences could have lasting effects. And I’m sure none of the pool owners reading this are planning on shutting down their pool, but we wanted to write about the consequences it can have just so you are aware and can do everything in your power to make sure it doesn’t happen to you.

The first consequence is, of course, the money it costs to not only shut down your pool but to reopen it. Just because you’ve shut down your pool doesn’t mean that you can stop maintaining it. You need to make sure that you’re still running your filter, still cleaning, and that everything is up to code for when you do get the chance to reopen.

And during that time that your pool is closed, you won’t be getting any money in admissions or concessions, which can be big if that’s where a lot of the profits come from at your indoor pool. So not only will you be spending money to maintain your pool, but you will not be able to earn any of it back through your patrons.

Speaking of patrons, one of the biggest consequences of a close is that your swimmers will need to find somewhere new to cool off. That could mean that you lose people who have been swimming at your pool for years. Most people just want somewhere to get away from the heat, so when they see your doors closed, they may not even check if it’ll be reopened.

Last but not least, closing your pool could hurt your reputation in the area and could keep future swimmers from coming to swim at your indoor pool. For whatever reason you have to close, you have the possibility of rumors swirling that is a much more devious reason. And on top of that, you could have new swimmers that are looking for a pool, see that yours is closed, and never consider it again.

These are just a few of the consequences that shutting down your indoor pool can have. From the lost revenue to the costs of maintaining an empty pool and the tarnished reputation to the lost future swimmers, there are plenty of reasons why you want to keep your pool open. That’s why Truox is in the business of helping you make it as easy as can be to keep your indoor pool open!
