Breathing EZ This Summer
blog

We’re getting to those days where you can feel the air when you walk outside. The humidity, the heat, it all comes together for a thickness in the air. And you, as a pool owner, provide one of the few senses of relief. But if a swimmer walks into your pool area and can feel the air there too, they’ll walk right on out.

That thickness, along with the odor that comes with it, can be caused by the chlorine you use to clean your pool mixing with the bacteria from the swimmers. This reaction produces chloramines, which are one of leading causes of recreational water illnesses. These chloramines enter the air from the pool water and can cause irritation to your eyes, lungs, and nose.

Because chloramines are heavier and denser than normal air, they’ll normally stay around the pool water’s surface. Meaning that, if left untreated, they will continue to build up on each other until your swimmers are walking through a cloud of chloramines as they enter the pool. And you don’t want the reputation of being the stinky pool around the community.

That’s where the BreatheEZ from Truox can come in to save the day. The technology was inspired by one simple idea: get those chloramines out of your pool area. This is done with our advanced oxidation technology, which produces free radicals. These free radicals generate 2700mV of Oxidation Potential, which quickly destroys the chloramines as well as any bacteria from the swimmers as they enter the pool. After the chloramines are destroyed, free chlorine is released from the byproducts and back into the water so it can do its job of keeping your pool clean. It’s an incredibly easy system to implement and maintain, making it one of the easiest ways to make sure your pool has the best air quality in town.

In fact, researchers from Purdue and Michigan State conducted a study with the CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code to test out the Breathe EZ system and its effectiveness against chloramines. Their study showed that on the very same day of implementation, the chloramine concentration was virtually eliminated, with a concentration more than 10 times lower than on the previous day.

And, if you don’t want to just take our word for how awesome this system works, you can try it yourself with a free trial. We’re extremely proud of this system and are so confident in its ability to help your pool’s air quality that we want to give you the system a try for free to see it with your own eyes. We know you’ll be as thrilled about the results as we are.

So leave that thick, humid air at the door this summer. When you’re working with the BreatheEZ system at your pool, you’ll only know the cleanest, freshest air. Your swimmers will thank you as they hop into your pool, refreshed and content to be soaking the dog days of summer away.
