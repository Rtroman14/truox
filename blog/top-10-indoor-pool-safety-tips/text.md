The Truox team isn’t shy about our love for indoor pools and swimming, but we know that we can only enjoy indoor pools if we do so safely. We are so fortunate to have indoor pools and all bodies of water for pleasure and exercise, but water is a much more powerful force than any person and it is important to respect it.

To help keep you and your family safe at your next indoor pool outing, the Truox team is sharing our top 10 indoor pool safety tips with you today!

Truox’s Top 10 Indoor Pool Safety Tips

    Know your limits and the limits of your group

Self-awareness is key to water safety. Know your limits and understand how long you and the other swimmers in your group can remain strong, capable swimmers. Once you or your group members reach that limit, it is important to take a break or call it quits for the day.

    Always swim with a lifeguard or buddy

Never swim alone, even in an indoor pool. Accidents happen all of the time and it is much easier to stop an accident from becoming a tragedy when there is someone else there. Always swim where you know there is a lifeguard or at the very least another adult who you know you could rely on in an emergency.

    Never dive in a no diving zone

It can be tempting to do tricks or dive right near the diving zone, but those rules were not put in place without reason. Diving in shallow pools is one of the leading causes of pool injuries and deaths, both of which are easily avoided by obeying rules and signage.

    Avoid drains and find the emergency shutoff

Pool drains and suction outlets are another source of injury and death at pools. It is very easy for loose hair, jewelry, bathing suit ties, or even limbs to become stuck in the drains, trapping you under water. Avoid swimming near drains, teach your children to do the same, and locate the emergency shut off at your indoor pool just in case you need to use it.

    Ensure the pools you visit have proper drain covers

In addition to avoiding drains entirely, you need to make sure that the drains at your indoor pool are properly covered. Confirm with your indoor pool staff that drain grates and covers meet industry safety standards and never be afraid to ask for proof if you have concerns.

    Take a CPR class

All adult swimmers should be trained in CPR so they are able to assist in an emergency situation. Taking a class that focuses on child and adult CPR will ensure you are prepared to help in most pool emergencies, potentially saving a life.

    Discourage rough play

Kids are always tempted to horse around at the pool, it’s like a magnet to them. Unfortunately, rough play can lead to avoidable injury and even death. Discourage your kids from rough play by giving them alternative safe games and toys to use instead.

    Don’t run around the pool

Indoor pools are often surrounded with slick tile flooring that is easy to slip and fall on, even when walking at a normal pace. To keep yourself safe, always walk, never run, and invest in pool shoes with good traction to avoid accidents.

    Avoid alcohol use

It can be tempting to crack an adult beverage at your hotel’s indoor pool on vacation, but wait until you and your family are done with water to pour a drink. Alcohol lowers our reflexes, balance, and coordination, all of which can lead to trouble if you are swimming or if your child needs your help while swimming.

Review pool maintenance rules

Before getting in a new-to-you indoor pool, ask about their maintenance procedures. How often is the pool cleaned? What chemicals do they use? When do they replace their filters? Most indoor pools are extremely clean, but poorly maintained pools certainly give the rest of them a bad reputation!

By following Truox’s indoor pool rules, you and your family can swim safely in indoor pools all year long! And to any lifeguards or pool pros that might be reading here, sound off with your safety tips in the comments below!
