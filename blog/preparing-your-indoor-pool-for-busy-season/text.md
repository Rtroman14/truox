Preparing Your Indoor Pool for Busy Season
blog

We’re getting close, folks! The temperature is starting to dip (a bit, barely), the leaves are starting to turn, and footballs are about to be kicked off. That can only mean one thing to an indoor pool facility owner: busy season is right around the corner. Outdoor pools are starting to close their doors for the year, and that means that swimmers will need a place to get their laps in. And who will be there to help them? You! But not just quite yet. To get your pool ready for the busy season, we decided to write a blog on some tips that will help you be ready to open those doors.

The first thing you should do is perform a quick inspection of your facility to make sure that everything is up to code. If you’ve been open throughout the summer, then you should have been doing so throughout the season, but if you are opening for the first time after Labor Day, then a quick look through should be high on your priority list.

You’ll want to make sure that all of your safety equipment is where it is supposed to be. The last thing you want to do during an emergency is frantically search for equipment, so making sure everything is in place is a must. You’ll also want to make sure that there are no cracks or holes in the pool surface. And while you are checking for cracks, you’ll want to brush and vacuum to make sure your pool is as clean as can be.

And on the subject of cleaning, you’ll want to make sure that your pool water is ready to be jumped into. That means that you’ll need to clean any debris that may have gathered in the water. And you’ll also want to test the water for its pH, alkalinity, and chlorine levels. If these levels are off in either direction, the water can cause irritation, sickness, and general unpleasantness for your swimmers, so you’ll want to balance them. Your pH should be at 7.2-7.8, your alkalinity at 80 – 120 parts per million, and your chlorine at 2-3 parts per million.

Once you’ve gotten your pool water and area ready to go, the last step is making sure that your staff is ready to assist with any unexpected situations that can occur at an indoor pool. Whether they’ve been working during the summer or are just getting going, you’ll want to refresh everyone on the training and make sure they are all up to the task of keeping your indoor pool safe.

Now, you are ready. You can look at each falling leaf with a smile on your face, knowing that your indoor pool is about to be the place to be this fall and winter. Your water is clean, it’s balanced, your staff is ready to go, and your swimmers are ready to enjoy. So open up those doors and get ready to bring a smile to every swimmer in the city.
