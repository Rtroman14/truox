Operating Public Swimming Pools
Safety

Recreational water illnesses are one of the most common illnesses associated with swimming in a public pool. There is a variety of symptoms, from irritated skin and respiratory systems to diarrhea. It’s an issue that requires pool staff, swimmers, and health departments to work together to try and prevent the disease from spreading. The pool staff are one of the first line of defense because poor maintenance can lead to lower disinfectant levels which help spread the variety of germs that cause RWIs. But don’t be nervous! We have a list of simple steps that pool managers and staff can take to keep their pool as healthy as can be.

Obtain state or local authority-recommended operator and chemical handling training

Getting the necessary training will help you know all the ins and outs of your pool and will provide you with the most up-to-date practices to keep your pool as clean as possible.

Ensure availability of trained operation staff during the weekend when pools are used most

Having a trained professional there at all times helps ensure that you aren’t stuck waiting on someone to arrive or, even worse, Monday to roll around when an issue occurs.

Maintain free chlorine levels continuously between 1-3 parts per million

Too much chlorine can lead to increased chloramine production which will give your pool an overpowering odor and can make it easier for germs to be transferred through the air.

Maintain the pH level of the water at 7.2-7.8

Too acidic or too basic can cause irritations on the skin and lungs, so maintaining a steady pH level can help keep your swimmers comfortable in the water.

Test pH and disinfectant levels at least twice per day (hourly when in heavy use)

These levels can constantly change throughout the day, so making sure that they are at an acceptable level should be something you do multiple times a day.

Maintain accurate records of disinfectant/pH measurements and maintenance activities

Keeping an accurate log of records for each time you check the disinfectant/pH levels can help keep the whole pool staff up to date on anything they may need to look out for, and also informs everyone that you are staying on top of your testing.

Maintain filtration and recirculation systems according to manufacturer recommendations

Filtration and recirculation are both key processes to keeping your pool clean, so making sure these are both maintained will help prevent RWIs.

Ensure cleanliness and safety of restrooms, showers, and diaper changing areas

Dirty restrooms, showers, and diaper changing areas will rapidly increase the spread of germs into your pool, so cleaning these at least once a day can have huge effects on your pool’s overall cleanliness.

Ensure bather load limits

The more people in your pool at one time, the quicker germs and other bacteria will spread, so having a maximum capacity of your pool can help slow down the transmission of diseases.

Scrub pool surfaces to remove any slime layer

This slime can contain tons of bacteria and germs and is just generally unpleasant to brush up against while swimming, so cleaning the pool daily to remove the slime layer can help maintain your pool’s cleanliness.

Drain and replace portions of the water on a weekly to monthly basis, depending on usage and water quality

Taking out dirty, used water and replacing it with clean water will ensure that germs and other bacteria aren’t lurking in your pool.

Treat the pool with biocidal shock treatment on a daily to weekly basis, depending on water quality and frequency of water replacement

Shocking the pool system with disinfectant and other cleaning products is a great way to make sure that your pool is as healthy as can be.

Institute a preventative maintenance program to replace equipment or parts before they fail

Equipment failing can have catastrophic effects on your pool’s overall health, so inspecting the parts often and replacing anything that needs to be fixed can help your pool system continue to run smoothly.

Provide disinfection guidelines for fecal accidents and body fluid spills

Having measures in place should there be any bodily fluids in your pool can help quickly combat the issues that those problems present.

Develop employee policies for staff who are ill with RWIs and a communication chain for reporting operation problems

Make sure you or your staff stay home if they are feeling sick, as anyone is able to spread disease. Also, have a system set up where any operation problems are quickly and accurately reported so that these issues can be solved as soon as possible.

Implement large group orientations, particularly for young children, and bathroom break policies to promote healthy swimming

Having a quick class for pool newcomers is a great way to ensure these new swimmers know how to maintain a safe pool environment. Making sure all swimmers know the dangers of going to the bathroom in the pool should be part of this orientation.

Educate pool users and parents about RWIs and appropriate pool use

The more that pool users know about RWIs and appropriate pool use, the safer your pool environment is going to be.

These are just some of the ways that you can help prevent the spread of recreation water illnesses. While you can’t keep out every last germ and bacteria, putting these tips to use will help keep your pool environment as healthy as can be. A pool where everyone leaves feeling healthy is a pool that people will want to return to.
