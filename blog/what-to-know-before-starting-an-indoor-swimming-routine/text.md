5 Things to Know Before Starting an Indoor Swimming Routine

    Swimming is should always be cleared with your doctor first

Indoor swimming is a full body workout and like all new exercise programs, you should always check with your doctor before starting a new routine. Your doctor will be able to confirm that indoor swimming is a safe activity for you and how to best approach it based on your current fitness level. Once you’re cleared, it’s time to dive in!

    You’re likely going to be more sore than you expect

One of the biggest surprises for new indoor swimmers is how sore they find themselves after a workout. Because swimming is low impact and joint friendly, people often underestimate just how intense swimming is, but don’t be fooled! Swimming is one heck of a workout and when you’re first getting started you are going to work muscles you’ve never worked before. Get ready to feel the burn.

    You can expect to see more than just physical changes

We tend to focus on the physical changes that a new exercise program gives to us, but there is so much more to it than that. Indoor swimming is rhythmic, repetitive, and balanced. These movement patterns can help bring a feeling of peace and calm to your body, leaving you mental clear and ready to tackle the day ahead when you’re finished.

    Not all indoor pools are created equal

When properly maintained, indoor pools are safe ways to get a great workout all year round! But the few bad apples that are not properly maintained tend to give the rest of them a bad reputation. When signing up for a new gym or sports club, inquire about the cleaning and safety standards they adhere to at their indoor pool. How often do they clean the filters? Do they always have a lifeguard on dutry? Do they use Truox’s Breathe EZ technology?

    You might start to feel like a kid again!

When is the last time you went swimming for fun? For so many adults it was the beach vacation they took to Florida… when they were 10! Swimming is a great way to bring your inner child out and tune into the wonder you felt back then which can then unlock creativity, passion, and excitement in all areas of your life.

Indoor swimming is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself this winter and there are almost no barriers to entry. Consult with your doctor and get ready to change your life!
