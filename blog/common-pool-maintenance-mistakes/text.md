Common Pool Maintenance Mistakes
blog

It’s been said that mistakes are just opportunities to learn. That’s at least what I try to tell myself whenever I make a mistake. And trust me, I’ve made plenty. But let these common pool maintenance mistakes become your chance to make sure you know the best ways to keep your pool safer, cleaner, and more fun overall!

Adding Shock Directly Into the Pool Water
When shocking your pool, what you’re doing is putting concentrated chlorine. And if the concentration gets high enough, it can bleach everything in your pool, from clothes to the vinyl liner. This can cause the area to become damaged, which can lead to leaks.

What you want to do is put the shock into a bucket of water before you put it in your pool. This helps it dissolve more evenly in your pool, so one area is not over-affected. And you also want to make sure that you are putting the chemicals into an already filled bucket of water and not vice versa, in case of splash back.

Not Brushing Your Pool
To truly look and perform its best, your pool needs to be brushed. You already know that vacuuming regularly will keep the debris from building up, but most pool owners skip over the brush. Brushing is especially effective in those hard to reach areas that a vacuum might miss, like behind ladders, steps, stairs, corners, and more.

Not Checking Your pH
You should be monitoring the pH level of your pool consistently to ensure a good swim. A low pH means your pool is very acidic and a high pH means there is too much alkalinity. Either of these is not great for your pool or the swimmers that want to enjoy it. A low pH can damage your pool equipment, like the pool pump, filter, vinyl liner, heater, and more. So make sure you are checking your pool water regularly and adjusting as needed with alkalinity increaser, pH increaser, and other chemicals.

Running Your Pool Filter System Less than Eight Hours a Day
Think of cleaning your pool as your filter system’s full time job. It needs to put in the work to make sure that your pool is as clean as can be. The more it is run, the less contaminants you’ll find in your pool. So make sure that you’re running your filter system for at least eight hours every day, and sometimes more depending on the size of the pool!

These are just a few of the common maintenance problems that we’ve run into during our time. Now, there’s obviously a lot more, but we’re saving those for the sequel! But for now, make sure you are avoiding these mistakes and learning from the errors of those before you so you can have the cleanest, most fun pool in the city!
