10 Gift Ideas for the Indoor Swimmer in Your Life

Swim Safe Smart Watch

If your indoor swimming guru likes to track stats like calories burned, laps completed, or their time, a swim safe smart watch is a great gift to consider. There are many models that come at different points and offer different features, so do a bit of research to decide which is the best fit for them!

Luxurious Bathrobe or Towel

Getting out of an indoor swimming pool might not feel as cold as swimming outside in the winter, but it is still quite chilly! Having a highend bathrobe or towel to dry off and warm up with is such a nice treat and will be very appreciated.

Water Shoes

The flooring at indoor pools can be extremely slippery. Having a pair of water shoes to put on as soon as they get out of the pool will keep the indoor swimmer you love safe in and out of the pool!

Underwater Earbuds

Swimming for exercise used to mean exercising in silence, but not anymore! There are dozens of high quality underwater earbuds on the market which means that you can gift your loved one the gift of their favorite music, podcast, or audiobook wherever they are!

Breathable Mesh Bag

If your swimmer tends to head right from the pool to the office, they need a bag that will allow their clothing to breathe. Letting it sit in a closed bag for eight plus hours after they’re finished with their swim is sure to cause mold, mildew, or just a nasty odor to accumulate. Give them the gift of a breathable bag to keep their gear clean!

New Swimsuits
To an indoor swimming fanatic, there is no such thing as too many swimsuits. Consider gifting a few new suits or even a gift certificate to a popular swimsuit brand if you aren’t sure about their sizes!

Swim Cap and Goggles Kit

Swim caps and goggles are small, which means they are easy to lose and a swimmer can never have too many of these either. A nice swim cap, goggles, and goggles case will always be a welcomed and well-used gift!

Shampoo and Conditioner for Swimmers

Although chlorine isn’t the kiss of death for hair that it is sometimes made out to be, the chemicals can still impact your hair and you should handle your hair with care. Specialty shampoo and conditioner for swimmers can be a bit pricey which means indoor swimming fans love to receive them as a gift.

Training Kickboard

If the swimmer in your life is a young one, an elderly one, or a new one, they may very much appreciate a training kickboard. Training kickboards offer support to give swimmers confidence in the water and a sense of safety when they’re just getting started.

Massage Gift Certificate

As we’ve previously mentioned, indoor swimming is a low-impact, joint safe activity that you can do for life, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a killer workout. Swimming works muscles in a way that no other sport does and that can lead to soreness in even the most experienced swimmers. We can guarantee that anyone with an indoor swimming routine would absolutely love to receive a massage gift certificate!

We hope you find something for the indoor swimming fan in your life on this list and if any indoor swimming enthusiasts have anything else to add, please share it with us in the comments!
